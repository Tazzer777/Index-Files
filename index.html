Dear Peter,<br><br>
<b>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</b><br><br>
I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on Trade Me on 14 February 2013.<br><br>
I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the position, including:<br>
<ul>
<li>time management and strong organisational skills</li>
<li>high-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
<li>cash handling and sales ability</li>
<li>motivation and dedication</li>
</ul>
As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail career.<br><br>
I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview.<br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>
Yours sincerely,<br><br>
Lizzie Long</p>
